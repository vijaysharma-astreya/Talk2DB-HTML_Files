    <h1>Top 5 High-Risk Agent Insights</h1>
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Poor Device Health Concentrated Under Specific Managers</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> For certain managers, over 30% of their direct reports are using devices that are either non-compliant or have not checked in within the last 15 days. This concentration of poor device hygiene within specific teams points to a lack of local oversight and impacts the collective productivity and security posture of those departments.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight Type:</strong> Policy Violation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Unarchived Consumable Records of Ex-Employees</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Detects active consumable asset records in the ITAM system assigned to employees who were terminated more than 90 days ago. Retaining this personally identifiable information (PII) in active systems violates data retention policies like GDPR and indicates a failure in offboarding data governance.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight Type:</strong> Policy Violation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Corporate Devices Missing Basic Security Controls</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Multiple company-owned Apple devices are operating without a passcode enabled or full supervision by IT. This violates security policy and exposes corporate data to significant risk if a device is lost or stolen.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight Type:</strong> Policy Violation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Non-Compliant Personal Devices Accessing Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Over 25 personal devices (BYOD) used for work are flagged as 'Non-Compliant' in the management system. This policy violation means they lack required security configurations, such as up-to-date anti-virus or encryption, creating a weak link that compromises the security of corporate data and systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight Type:</strong> Policy Violation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Lagging Device Syncs Hamper Engineering Productivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Over 15% of active employees in the Engineering department are using devices that have not synchronized with management systems in more than 7 days. This lag is a leading indicator of device or network performance degradation, which directly risks developer productivity and project timelines by disrupting access to critical tools and code repositories.</p>
            <p><strong>Insight Type:</strong> Usage Anomaly</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <p>The high-risk insights are primarily related to policy violations and usage anomalies, indicating potential security vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies. Addressing these issues can significantly improve the organization's security posture and productivity.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Concentrated 'Ghost Asset' Risk Under Managers</td>
            <td>Specific managers oversee teams with a high number of devices that have not checked into the network in over 60 days. This concentration points to a systemic breakdown in asset stewardship within these teams, creating a significant security blind spot and increasing the risk of data breaches from lost or unmanaged devices. Engaging these few managers offers a targeted way to mitigate widespread asset loss.</td>
            <td>Security Risk</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Conflicting Device Records Across MDM Platforms</td>
            <td>The same physical device, identified by its serial number, has conflicting data between the Mosyle and Intune management systems, such as different assigned users or OS versions. This data conflict corrupts compliance reports and obscures true asset ownership and security posture.</td>
            <td>Security Risk</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prolonged Device Non-Compliance Impacts User Access</td>
            <td>Over 10% of Windows devices remain in a 'NonCompliant' state for more than 7 consecutive days, as tracked across daily data ingestions. This extended non-compliance period indicates slow IT remediation and often results in restricted access to corporate resources, creating a direct and measurable drag on employee productivity.</td>
            <td>Security Risk</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Corporate-Purchased Devices Misclassified as Personal</td>
            <td>Highlights devices recorded in Intune with an 'Personal' ownership type, despite evidence of a corporate purchase order for that model and user. This misclassification leads to lax security policies being applied, creating a compliance gap and security vulnerability.</td>
            <td>Governance Risk</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Corporate Devices Bypass Key Security Policies</td>
            <td>A subset of corporate devices managed by Microsoft Intune are not correctly registered with Azure AD. This configuration failure represents a critical security gap, as these devices can bypass Conditional Access policies designed to protect company data. This allows devices that do not meet security standards to potentially access sensitive resources, undermining the organization's zero-trust security posture and increasing the risk of a data breach.</td>
